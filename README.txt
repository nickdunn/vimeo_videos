[CHANGES]

2011-02-24
- Fixed compatability issue with preg_match().
- Fixed table prefix bug which prevented cache from being updated if table prefix was not 'sym_'.

2011-02-23
- Added support for thumbnail sizes (large, medium, small) as well as thumbnail dimensinos. To enable
  this on a Symphony site which already uses Vimeo vidoes field the extension must be reinstalled.
  
  Note: the thumbnail dimensions is calculated based on the assumption that the largest thumbnail has
  the same size as the video (which as far as I have been able to test, seems to be case).

0.1
- Initial release
