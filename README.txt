[INSTALLATION]

1. Download and upload the 'vimeo_videos' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

3. You can now add the "Vimeo Video Field" field to your sections.

[CHANGES]

2011-02-23
- Added support for thumbnail sizes (large, medium, small) as well as thumbnail dimensinos. To enable
  this on a Symphony site which already uses Vimeo vidoes field the extension must be reinstalled.
  
  Note: the thumbnail dimensions is calculated based on the assumption that the largest thumbnail has
  the same size as the video (which as far as I have been able to test, seems to be case).
